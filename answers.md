1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?

	new creates a new instance of the model but create will save it to the database

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?

	new and save

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
	
	ID, CREATED At, updated at

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?

	Cat.create name: "hat"

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?

	Everything. I don't understand how all the files work together with one another and the homework is so vague. I wish it would just tell us what to do in detail instead of just throwing us at the deep end

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?

	It was ok, but still really confusing. The class needs some form of typed notes online which would be a lot better than searching through the lecture for the right commands to use.
